# Conversation between Kazim (email: theyouguy1@gmail.com) and Umer (email: muhdumer.ats@gmail.com)

**Kazim**: Hey Umer, we need to discuss the Q2 project milestones and implementation timeline for the AI scheduling assistant. Are you free tomorrow at 2pm PKT? We should review the calendar API integration progress.

**Umer**: Tomorrow at 2pm PKT works for me. Can we make it a 1-hour meeting? I have another call at 3:30.

**Kazim**: Perfect, 1 hour should be enough. Here's what we need to cover:
1. Current status of Google Calendar integration
2. Progress on the context extraction module
3. Timeline for adding Microsoft Calendar support
4. Q2 milestone planning

**Umer**: Great agenda. Could you also add the GPT-4 integration discussion? Specifically about prompt optimization for better context understanding.

**Kazim**: Added to the agenda. I'll create a Google Meet link - we can use the same one for our weekly sync going forward. Would you prefer if we made this a recurring meeting every Wednesday at the same time?

**Umer**: Yes, a recurring meeting would be helpful. Every Wednesday at 2pm PKT works well for me. Let's start from tomorrow and we can adjust if needed.

**Kazim**: Perfect! I'll set it up as a weekly recurring meeting. Please come prepared with the latest updates on the calendar API implementation.

**Umer**: Will do. I'll share the current implementation docs before the meeting. See you tomorrow!
